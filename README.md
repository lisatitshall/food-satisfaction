# Food Satisfaction Study
This project uses R to explore an open dataset retrieved from the UK Data Service. 
The data relates to a study investigating the link between [remembered meal satisfaction and later snack intake](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/853370/).

## Study Summary
A study was conducted to test the effect of meal satisfaction on subsequent food intake. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups (with gender stratification so both genders were represented in each group):
- Satisfying rehearsal: Where participants are asked to reflect on the positive aspects of a meal
- Dissatisfying rehearsal: Where participants are asked to reflect on the negative aspects of a meal
- Neutral rehearsal: Where participants are asked to reflect on a question not related to the meal
In a lunchtime session all participants ate the same pasta and in a second session they ate biscuits. They were told the sessions were investigating the link between
personality and evaluation of savoury/sweet foods. The outcome variable was the total biscuit intake in kcals. 

Full details of the study can be found in the Data folder.
